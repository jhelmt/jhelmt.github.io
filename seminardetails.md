## Practical (transportation) details:

From within the UK, the easiest transportation is usually to travel by train to Durham. In some cases (or if visiting from outside the UK) it is easier to fly to Newcastle.
If you are flying, from Newcastle airport you can take the metro to Newcastle Central Station (travel time about 35 minutes), and then take a train to Durham (travel time about 12 minutes).
Alternatively, you can take a taxi to Durham. 

From Durham Station, it is a relatively short walk (approximately 30 minutes) to the math department. Alternatively, you can take a local bus.

## Seminar details:

The seminar runs from 14:00 -- 15:00 on Thursdays in MCS 2068.  We'll show you the way to the room, of course. The seminar room is
in fairly heavy use, and the Durham timetable means that talks actually start at 14:05 and must end (including questions) by 14:55. 
If you are using slides, please email them to us in advance: an overactive university antivirus system means large attachments can take a long time (order many minutes) to be processed.

The probability group / attendees of the probability seminar are a relatively diverse mathematical audience. Accessible talks are highly appreciated! If you are unsure about what this means, you might
