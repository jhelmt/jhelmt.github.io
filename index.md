## About
I am a mathematician working on problems in statistical mechanics and probability theory. My main interest is in understanding emergent phenomena and phase transitions: how (and when) do large numbers of interacting particles exhibit collective large-scale behaviours?

## Research
See my [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/search/?searchtype=author&query=Helmuth%2C+Tyler&abstracts=show&size=50&order=-announced_date_first) page.

## Events
**Upcoming** (as participant): [Statistical Mechanics of Lattice Systems, Brin Center, Maryland](https://brinmrc.umd.edu/spring26-smls/); [Statistical Mechanics: planar & beyond, Vienna](https://www.esi.ac.at/events/e589/). 

I co-organize the [Durham Probability Seminar](https://www.maths.dur.ac.uk/seminars/) with [Dr. Oliver Tough](https://sites.google.com/view/olivertough/). 

**Past** (as organiser): [Frontiers... workshops](https://willperkins.org/frontiersworkshops.html).

## Contact
I'm an associate professor in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at the University of Durham. You can email me: bhjm24 at durham dot ac dot uk. If you are in Durham, find me in MCS 3031.
