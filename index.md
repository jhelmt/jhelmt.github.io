## About
I am a mathematician working on problems in statistical mechanics and probability theory. My main interest is in understanding emergent phenomena and phase transitions: how (and when) do large numbers of interacting particles exhibit collective large-scale behaviours?

## Research
See my [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/search/?searchtype=author&query=Helmuth%2C+Tyler&abstracts=show&size=50&order=-announced_date_first) page.

## Events
**Upcoming** (as participant): [PiNE Workshop, Edinburgh](https://www.maths.dur.ac.uk/PiNE/25-11-20/index.html); [Topological Phase Transition and Localization of Random Fields, CMM, Chile](https://eventos.cmm.uchile.cl/cpp2025/); [Statistical Mechanics of Lattice Systems, Brin Center, Maryland](https://brinmrc.umd.edu/spring26-smls/); [Statistical Mechanics: planar & beyond, Vienna](https://www.esi.ac.at/events/e589/). 

I co-organize the [Durham Probability Seminar](https://www.maths.dur.ac.uk/seminars/) with [Dr. Oliver Tough](https://sites.google.com/view/olivertough/). 

**Past** (as organiser): [Frontiers... workshops](https://willperkins.org/frontiersworkshops.html).

## Open position
I am currently advertising a PDRA (postdoc) position in probability/statistical mechanics/mathematical physics, see [here](https://durham.taleo.net/careersection/du_ext/jobdetail.ftl?job=25001451&lang=en). The position is for 36 months (there is an additional 6 months of funding beyond the grant duration). Please contact me if you are interested in applying and have questions! The application deadline is December 7th.

## Contact
I'm an associate professor in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at the University of Durham. You can email me: bhjm24 at durham dot ac dot uk. If you are in Durham, find me in MCS 3031.
